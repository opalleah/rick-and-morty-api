# Rick and Morty API

## Project Overview
The Rick and Morty API project is an exploration of the vast universe of "Rick and Morty" by leveraging the Rick and Morty API. This API provides extensive data about characters and episodes from the beloved animated series. The goal of this project is to create an interactive and dynamic JavaScript application that allows users to explore and interact with the rich content offered by the API.

## Functionality

### Character Information
- The application displays detailed information about characters, including names, species, and statuses.

### Episode Listing
- It presents a list of episodes with relevant details such as episode name, air date, and episode code.

## API Interaction and Testing
- Thorough research of the Rick and Morty API, evaluating its endpoints, and testing different API methods using Postman.
- Evaluation criteria included response times, data accuracy, and the overall reliability of the API.

## JavaScript Application
- Implementation: Developed a JavaScript application that interacts with the Rick and Morty API to dynamically fetch and display information.
- Extension: Expanded the initial application by adding one to two additional web pages, each focusing on a different aspect of the Rick and Morty universe.
